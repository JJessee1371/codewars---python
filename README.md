# Codewars - Python

## Description
Each sub folder within the parent folder of this project contains both a README file and the Python file. I have included the README to copy over the task
given in the Codewars kata and any constraints that were included so that readers understand the goal. The Python file will include the solution(s) that I 
came to along with some of the community solutions that are ranked as being the best practice. These other solutions are included so that as I practice with
Python I can see how to better refine my logic for more elegant solutions.
